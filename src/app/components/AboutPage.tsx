              I&apos;m a passionate <b> Computer Science undergraduate </b> specializing in 
              <b> Cloud Computing </b> at JECRC University, with a strong 
              <b> 8.3 CGPA </b> and hands-on experience in 
              <b> full-stack development </b>. My journey in tech has been shaped by 
              <b> real-world internships </b> at <b> Celebal Technologies </b>, where I&apos;ve worked on both 
              <b> backend development </b> and <b> data science projects </b>, gaining expertise in building 
              <b> scalable web applications </b> and <b> machine learning solutions </b>.
            </p>

            <p className="pt-4">
              As a <b> full-stack developer </b>, I specialize in creating 
              <b> secure, scalable applications </b> using modern technologies including 
              <b> React.js, Node.js, Express </b>, and various databases like <b> MongoDB and PostgreSQL </b>. 
              My technical toolkit spans from frontend frameworks and responsive design to 
              <b> backend APIs, authentication systems </b>, and containerization with 
              <b> Docker </b>. I&apos;ve successfully delivered projects like 
              <b> Transactly </b>, a secure payment transfer application, and developed 
              interactive portfolio websites that showcase my commitment to <b> clean code </b> and 
              <b> user experience </b>.
            </p>

            <p className="pt-4">
              Beyond development, I bring valuable experience in <b> data science and machine learning </b>, 
              having worked with <b> Python, Scikit-learn, and NLP models </b> during my recent internship. 
              I&apos;m currently learning <b> Generative AI </b> and implementing it into my projects, including a 
              <b> website clone generator </b> that demonstrates AI-powered development tools. 
              This diverse skill set, combined with my <b> 5Ã— Microsoft Azure certifications </b>, 
              positions me uniquely to tackle complex technical challenges across different domains.
